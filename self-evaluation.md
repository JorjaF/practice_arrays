How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far? I still feel shakey on these. It has been a long day and I don't know if I really get it.

Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson? I just really need some time to practice this to get comformable

What questions do you have about Arrays? So far I have been getting a lot of help from Tim on this.
